# Python wrapper

run

```
python ./main.py
```

## Requirements

* matplotlib
* numpy

## Note

* In windows, by default, a dll built with `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` toolchain will be downloaded and loaded. 
  If you want to build the dll by yourself, please run `../build.ps1` script on powershell. 
  (In the author's environment, the dll built with `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` toolchain was faster.)
